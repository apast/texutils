	abstract = "Event-based communication is used in different domains including telecommunications, transportation, and business information systems to build scalable distributed systems. The loose coupling of components in such systems makes it easy to vary the deployment. At the same time, the complexity to estimate the behavior and performance of the whole system is increased, which complicates capacity planning. In this paper, we present an automated performance prediction method supporting capacity planning for event-based systems. The performance prediction is based on an extended version of the Palladio Component Model - a performance meta-model for component-based systems. We apply this method on a real-world case study of a traffic monitoring system. In addition to the application of our performance prediction techniques for capacity planning, we evaluate the prediction results against measurements in the context of the case study. The results demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

This task is especially important for systems, such as publish/subscribe systems, that are used in dynamic environments. In these settings, a static configuration usually leads to a largely suboptimal system performance, while manual optimization is either too expensive or not possible at all. Distributed publish/subscribe system are usually realized by a broker overlay network providing the functionality of a decentralized notification service. In this paper, we present an approach that self-optimizes the routing configuration of a publish/subscribe broker overlay network to minimize the operational costs of the system without any manual intervention. It is based on a new class of routing algorithms, which allows a link-by-link adaptation of the routing configuration at runtime. Based on a local decision criterion, a decentralized optimization algorithm is introduced that generates only marginal extra traffic.",

Applications in these areas typically have stringent requirements for performance and scalability. To guarantee adequate quality-of-service, systems must be subjected to a rigorous performance and scalability analysis before they are put into produc- tion. In this paper, we present a comprehensive modeling methodology for message-oriented event-driven systems in the context of a case study of a representative ap- plication in the supply chain management domain. The methodology, which is based on queueing Petri nets, pro- vides a basis for performance analysis and capacity plan- ning. We study a deployment of the SPECjms2007 stan- dard benchmark on a leading commercial middleware platform. A detailed system model is built in a step-by- step fashion and then used to predict the system perfor- mance under various workload and configuration scenar- ios. After the case study, we present a set of generic per- formance modeling patterns that can be used as build- ing blocks when modeling message-oriented event-driven systems. The results demonstrate the effectiveness, prac- ticality and accuracy of the proposed modeling and pre- diction approach.",

abstract = {Over the last few years, the Java Community Process (under the auspices of Java Specification Request 302) has been developing a subset of Java augmented by the Real-Time Specification for Java (RTSJ) for use in safety critical systems. The concurrency model supported by Safety Critical Java (SCJ) relies almost exclusively on an event-based model rather than on a thread-based model. This paper reviews the advantages and disadvantages of the two models and gives the pragmatic reasons that SCJ has adopted the former model. It describes the SCJ approach and gives a simple example of how it can be used, illustrating the difference in style between the RTSJ and SCJ code. The paper then considers the compatibility of the SCJ model with the RTSJ. It argues that by basing the SCJ classes on the RTSJ's BoundAsyncEvent class, some inconsistencies exist between the SCJ and the RTSJ models. Furthermore, some of the optimizations that are possible when mapping handlers to server threads are inhibited, even though the programming restrictions necessary for these optimizations are imposed by the SCJ specification. A revised model is presented that has a slightly more complicated API but is more consistent with the RTSJ and allows the optimizations. However, there is a resulting increase in the necessary run-time support, particularly for multiprocessor implementations. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={In the context of fixed-priority scheduling, feasibility of a task set with non-preemptive scheduling does not imply the feasibility with preemptive scheduling and vice versa. We use the notion of preemption threshold, first introduced by Express Logic, in their ThreadX real-time operating system, to develop a scheduling model that subsumes both preemptive and non-preemptive fixed priority scheduling. Preemption threshold allows a task to only disable preemption of tasks up to a specified threshold priority. Tasks having priorities higher than the threshold are still allowed to preempt. With this new scheduling model, we show that schedulability is improved as compared to both the preemptive and nonpreemptive scheduling models. We develop the equations for computing the worst-case response times, using the concept of level-i busy period. Some useful results about the generalized model are presented and an algorithm for optimal assignment of priority and preemption threshold is designed based on these results},

Intermediate nodes relay the source nodes' data packets to destination nodes. When an intermediate node steals a source node's ID within relayed data packets, it can impersonate the source node. In this paper, we have proposed a new detection method against such impersonation attacks using Bloom Filters and a Secret-Sharing-Scheme-based Dispersed Data Transfer method. In addition, we simulated this scheme to confirm its effectiveness.},

abstract={We develop an on-demand multipath distance vector protocol for mobile ad hoc networks. Specifically, we propose multipath extensions to a well-studied single path routing protocol known as ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV). The resulting protocol is referred to as ad hoc on-demand multipath distance vector (AOMDV). The protocol computes multiple loop-free and link-disjoint paths. Loop-freedom is guaranteed by using a notion of "advertised hopcount". Link-disjointness of multiple paths is achieved by using a particular property of flooding. Performance comparison of AOMDV with AODV using ns-2 simulations shows that AOMDV is able to achieve a remarkable improvement in the end-to-end delay-often more than a factor of two, and is also able to reduce routing overheads by about 20%.},
